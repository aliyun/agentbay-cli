# AgentBay CLI

A command-line interface for AgentBay services.

## Features

AgentBay CLI provides comprehensive image management capabilities:

**Note**: The current version of the CLI tool supports creating and activating CodeSpace type images only.

- **Authentication**: Secure OAuth-based login with Aliyun account integration
- **Dockerfile Template**: Download Dockerfile templates from the cloud
- **Image Creation**: Build custom images from Dockerfiles with base image support
- **Image Management**: Activate, deactivate, and monitor image instances
- **Image Listing**: Browse user and system images with separated display, pagination and filtering support
- **Configuration Management**: Secure token storage and automatic token refresh

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Log in to AgentBay
agentbay login

# 2. List available images
agentbay image list                    # List user images (default)
agentbay image list --include-system   # List both user and system images
agentbay image list --system-only      # List only system images

# 3. Download Dockerfile template
agentbay image init                    # Download Dockerfile template to current directory

# 4. Create a custom image (using system image as base)
agentbay image create myapp --dockerfile ./Dockerfile --imageId code-space-debian-12

# 5. Activate the image
agentbay image activate imgc-xxxxx...xxx

# 6. Deactivate when done
agentbay image deactivate imgc-xxxxx...xxx
```

**Note**:
- System images are always available and don't require activation. Only user-created images need to be activated before use.
- When downloading Dockerfile templates, the first N lines (N is returned by the system) are system-defined and cannot be modified. Only modify content after line N+1.
